# Biomebased-Wood

**Description:**

A plugin that makes the wood type in mineshafts and villages be determined by biome.

Note: Setting blocks in chunks less than 20 seconds after it's generated can bug out and it won't update the setting, so this plugin waits 20 seconds from generation before it updates

This also makes the double slab in blacksmiths in villages to be an anvil.
